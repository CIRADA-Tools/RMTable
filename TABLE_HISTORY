This file records the history of changes to the RMTable standard.

1.0: Initial version

1.1: (25 Sep 2020)
Added flexibility in terms of handling non-standard columns. 
These will not be imported by the input_numpy function by default, but are preserved
under read/write operations (read/write_FITS, read/write_TSV, to_numpy, to_pandas).
Added rmsf_fwhm column, with the caveat that this is only really well-defined for RM synthesis.
Added additional default string options.


1.2 (Aug 2021)
Removed columns that were seen as unnecessary: id, flagA/B/C_name, flagA/B/C_value.
The functionality that the flags gave is not useful given the support for non-standard columns.
The consolidated catalog doesn't really benefit from having those columns, so they can were removed.
The id column, intended to give a unique source numbering to the consolidated catalog, isn't needed.
The aperture column, which describes over how large a sky area the brightness/RM was determined, was added.
Some string lengths were modified to be more consistent.

1.3 (Mar 2023)
Renamed two columns that conflicted with SQL reserved keywords:
    'catalog' became 'catalog_name'
    'interval' became 'obs_interval'
Removed string size specifications from string columns -- they can now be of
dynamic lengths. The length requirements turned out to be entirely unnecessary.
