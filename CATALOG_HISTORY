0.1.0 (26 Apr 2019): Initial catalog

0.1.1 (9 May 2019): Fixed a problem with unintended newlines being printing in tsv files.

0.1.2 (25 Jun 2019): Fixed a problem with the coordinates for the Taylor 2009 catalog.

0.1.3 (17 Jul 2019): Changed/added several columns for the new CGPS catalog, to match the descriptions given in the paper.

0.1.4 (22 Jul 2019): Found and fixed a mistake in the flux units for the new CGPS catalog, changed to conform to standard.

0.1.5 (29 Nov 2019): Large update of metadata to many catalogs added in 0.1.0. Metadata was taken from the text of the papers,
       where values could be easily found.

0.1.6 (28 Jan 2020): Added the Shannahan+2019 'THOR' RMs.

0.1.7 (10 Apr 2020): Removed new CGPS (not published yet). 
    Removed 'Oppermann-sourced' RMs: some were duplicates of other catalogs I processed, some were missing sources for unknown reasons.
    Corrected Vernstrom 2018 catalog; some declinations were computed wrongly.
    Added Gaensler 2001 RMs.
    Added Clarke 2001 RMs; these were not available from the paper, but were supplied by Tracy Clarke. Note these are NOT the Galactic-subtracted RMs, and are NOT the cluster-dispersion added errors.
    Added Ma 2019 RMs; RMTable was supplied directly by Jackie Ma.

0.1.8 (11 Sep 2020): Added rmsf_fwhm column; updated RMTable version number to 1.1. All catalogs updated to V1.1 (setting rmwf_fwhm to NaN).
    Fixed problems reported with some sources have declinations of exactly 0: this was a bug in how some machine readable tables were being processed.
        Affected catalogs: Taylor 2009, Van Eck 2011, Law 2011, Kim 2016
    Added Ma 2020 RMs; RMTable was supplied directly by Jackie Ma, and modified only by updating to V1.1 and updating catalog and data_ref bibcodes.
    Added POGS-II RMs (Riseley 2020); RMTable was supplied by Chris Riseley and modified only minimally (merging pulsar and EGS tables together, converting some extra columns to flag columns, updating to V1.1).

0.2.0 (12 Aug 2021):
    Catalog version incremented to 0.2; 0.2.x will be used for versions produced during the paper writing and review.
    From this point forward, catalogs will be called consolidated_catalog rather than master_catalog.
    Within the GitHub repository the catalogs will be ZIPed to reduce data size.
    Fixed catalog for POGS-II (Riseley 2020) to be bibcode.
    Fixed fracpol column in old CGPS RMs (Brown 2003) and SGPS (Brown 2007), was in percent now in fraction.
    Added rmsf_fwhm values from paper texts, for: 2009ApJ...707..114F, 2012ApJ...755...21M, 2015ApJ...815...49A, 2018A&A...613A..58V, 2018PASA...35...43R, 2019ApJ...871..215B, 2019ApJ...887L...7S, 2020MNRAS.497.3097M, 2020PASA...37...29R
    Updated SPASS-ATCA catalog (2019MNRAS.485.1293S): fixed incorrect reference frequencies, added spectral index errors, added 2nd fitted components to catalog (3rd components were not in table, so still ignored), added position errors (adding RA/Dec errors into quadrature)
    Converted consolidated catalog to table version 1.2, removing deprecated columns and adding the aperture column as appropriate where known. Reviewing all coordinates and converting to ICRS as appropriate.
    Taylor 2009: Added pos_err column, taking maximum of Declination or Right Ascension (corrected for units, declination effects) error. Converted coordintes from J2000 to ICRS.
    Van Eck 2017: Added pos_err column, same method. Converted coordinates.
    Schnitzeler 2019: Corrected pos_err column to use same method as above (previously was incorrect). flux_type added with new value: visibilities (fluxes estimated from uv-data, without imaging). Converted coordinates.
    Mao 2010, 2012a, 2012b: Added flux_type and aperture. Converted coordinates.
    O'Sullivan 2017: Fixed incorrect values for rm_width and rm_width_err where values should be missing.
    Rossetti 2008: Added more accurate coordinates by cross-matching to B3 catalog, except for one source which had no counterpart (possible typo in source name?).
    Kim 2016: Fixed mistaken telescope column; converted coordinates.
    Papers that have had equatorial coordinates converted from J2000 to ICRS:    
        Riseley 2018, Betti 2019, Costa 2016, 2018, Anderson 2015, Brown 2003, 2007, Feain 2009, Van Eck 2011, Simard-Normandin 1981, Klein 2003, Roy 2005, Mao 2008, Heald 2009, Vernstrom 2018, Law 2011, Broten 1988, Clegg 1992, Oren 1995, Minter 1996, Shanahan 2019, Gaensler 2001, Clarke 2001, Riseley 2020 
    
    Added new catalogs:
        Livingston 2021: provided RMTable by author
        Farnes 2014
        Van Eck 2021 (New CGPS). Minor updates from published version: catalog name changed to bib code, data reference added for CGPS survey description paper, coordinates converted from J2000 to ICRS
    
    
0.2.1:
    Fixed mistaken coordinates in Van Eck+ 2018 (2018A&A...613A..58V) catalog.

    Added new catalog:
        Livingston 2022 (2022MNRAS.510..260L, SMC RMs): csv file supplied by author; catalog and dataref columns changed from DOI to bibcode.


1.0.0:
    Created VOTable version of catalog. Updated full consolidated catalog to be compatible with code changes (adding UCDs, units, etc).
    No changes to contents of catalog.
    Updating to version 1 in anticipation of no further major changes before publication.
    Changed values:
        Rossetti 2008: 'flux_type' changed from 'Gaussian fit' to  'Gaussian fit - Peak' to match standard string.

1.0.1:
    Fixed problems with Riseley+ 2018 (POGS-I) catalog entries: rm and rm_err column had incorrect values, fracpol and error were missing, polint and error were in wrong units (mJy instead of Jy).

1.1.0:
    Converted tables to table format 1.3, which renames two of the columns to avoid SQL conflicts. No changes to contents of catalog.
